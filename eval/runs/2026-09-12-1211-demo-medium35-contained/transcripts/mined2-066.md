## Question

Which models can be chained in agent handoffs — is there a published list, or is any chat model allowed?

## Thinking

The user is asking about which Mistral models can be chained in agent handoffs. They want to know if there's a published list or if any chat model is allowed. I need to search the Mistral documentation for information about agent handoffs and model chaining capabilities. Let me start with a search query to find relevant documentation.

I received search results that point to the handoffs documentation. The first hit mentions "Create an Agentic Workflow" and states there's no limit to how many chained handoffs a workflow can have. However, it doesn't explicitly mention model restrictions. I need to read the full page to find details about which models can be used. Let me fetch the handoffs documentation page.

I've read the handoffs documentation page. The documentation states that there's no limit to how many chained handoffs a workflow can have, and you can create multiple agents using diverse tools, models, and handoffs. However, it doesn't explicitly list which models are allowed. The examples shown use `mistral-large-latest` and `mistral-medium-latest`, but this doesn't confirm whether these are the only allowed models or just examples.

I need to search more specifically for model compatibility information. Let me try a different search query to find any explicit restrictions or lists of compatible models for agent handoffs.

Excellent! The search results now show a hit from the Agents Introduction FAQ section that explicitly states: "Currently, only `mistral-medium-latest` and `mistral-large-latest` are supported, but we will soon enable it for more models." This directly answers the user's question. Let me read this page to confirm the exact wording and context.

Perfect! I now have the definitive answer. The documentation explicitly states in the Agents Introduction FAQ that currently only `mistral-medium-latest` and `mistral-large-latest` are supported for agents (which includes handoffs). The handoffs documentation also confirms that you can chain agents with diverse models, but the FAQ clarifies the specific limitation. I should provide a clear, direct answer with the exact models and the citation.

### Define Handoffs Responsabilities {#define-handoffs-responsibilities}

![handoffs_graph](https://docs.mistral.ai/img/responsibilities_handoffs.png)

Once all our Agents created, we update our previous defined Agents with a list of `handoffs` available.

**Python**

```py
# Allow the finance_agent to handoff the conversation to the ecb_interest_rate_agent or web_search_agent
finance_agent = client.beta.agents.update(
    agent_id=finance_agent.id,
    handoffs=[ecb_interest_rate_agent.id, web_search_agent.id]
)

# Allow the ecb_interest_rate_agent to handoff the conversation to the graph_agent or calculator_agent
ecb_interest_rate_agent = client.beta.agents.update(
    agent_id=ecb_interest_rate_agent.id,
    handoffs=[graph_agent.id, calculator_agent.id]
)

# Allow the web_search_agent to handoff the conversation to the graph_agent or calculator_agent
web_search_agent = client.beta.agents.update(
    agent_id=web_search_agent.id,
    handoffs=[graph_agent.id, calculator_agent.id]

## section: how-it-works
    Handoffs > How it Works
    cite: https://docs.mistral.ai/studio/agents/handoffs#how-it-works
## How it Works {#how-it-works}

Our workflow and behavior are defined, now we can run it.

We created 5 agents, some of them have access to built-in tools, and others to local tools like `get_european_central_bank_interest_rate`.

It is now possible to have a chain of actions by sending a request to the `finance_agent`.

We also provide the parameter `handoff_execution`, which currently has two modes: `server` or `client`.

- `server`: Runs the handoff as expected internally on our cloud servers; this is the default setting.
- `client`: When a handoff is triggered, a response is provided directly to the user, enabling them to handle the handoff with control.

Let’s trigger two different behaviors as examples:

**Example A**

**"Fetch the current US bank interest rate and calculate the compounded effect if investing for the next 10y"**

The first example asks for the US central bank interest rate, so we expect to involve the `websearch-agent` and then to calculate the compounded interest over 10 years. This should use the `calculator-agent` to do this.

![handoffs_graph_examplea](https://docs.mistral.ai/img/examplea_handoffs.png)

**Python**

```py
response = client.beta.conversations.start(
    agent_id=finance_agent.id,
    inputs="Fetch the current US bank interest rate and calculate the compounded effect if investing for the next 10y"
)
```

**Example B**

**"Given the interest rate of the European Central Bank as of jan 2025, plot a graph of the compounded interest rate over the next 10 years"**

The second example asks for the European central bank interest rate and to plot a graph of the compounded interest. Now we require a local function call since the `ecb-interest-rate-agent` will surelly be required.

    Handoffs > Create an Agentic Workflow
    When creating a workflow powered by Handoffs, we first need to create all the Agents that our workflow will use. There is no limit to how many chained Handoffs a workflow can have. You are free to create multiple Agents using diverse tools, models and handoffs, and orchestrate your own workflow using these Agents.

    Supported languages
    Mistral's language models are trained on multilingual data and support a wide range of languages. The lists below reflect languages with **strong expected performance**. Because of how models are trained, they can also perform well in additional languages not listed here.

## Answer

Currently, **only `mistral-medium-latest` and `mistral-large-latest` are supported** for use in agent handoffs. There is no published list beyond these two models, and the documentation explicitly states that support will soon be expanded to more models.
